# How Your Mind Creates Conflict: Understanding the Honeyball Sutta

## Introduction: Why We Fight Ourselves and Others

Have you ever noticed how a simple situation can turn into conflict? Someone makes a comment, and suddenly you're angry or hurt. A memory pops up, and you spiral into worry. You see something you want, and suddenly you're stressed trying to get it.

The interesting question is: where does the conflict actually come from? Is it from the event itself? Or is it something your mind does with the event?

The **Madhupiṇḍika Sutta (MN 18)**, recorded in Buddhist texts, gives a clear answer. The Buddha taught that conflict doesn't come from what happens to us. It comes from the stories our mind creates about what happens.

This sutta is called "The Honeyball Discourse" because wherever you examine this teaching, you find sweetness and wisdom. It describes a simple five-step process that explains not only why we suffer, but exactly how we create that suffering—and how to stop.

This article explores this sutta in detail, shows how it relates to modern TWIM (Teaching With Insight Meditation) practice, and most importantly, gives you practical tools to use this teaching today.

## Part One: The Setting and the Question

### Where the Teaching Happened

The Buddha was staying in the Banyan Tree Monastery in Kapilavatthu. After his alms round, he went into the Great Wood to meditate. This is important context because it shows the Buddha in a peaceful, contemplative state when this teaching emerged.

A man named Daṇḍapāṇi (literally "the one carrying a stick") approached the Buddha. He was a Sakyan—a member of the Buddha's own ethnic group. He asked directly: "What is the ascetic's doctrine? What does he assert?"

This is a straightforward question about what the Buddha teaches.

### The Buddha's Cryptic Answer

The Buddha's response was brief and, on the surface, confusing:

"My teaching is such that one does not quarrel with anyone in this world of gods, Māras, brahmins, and ascetics. It is such that perceptions do not underlie the one who is free of sensual craving, doubt, worry, and desire for becoming."

What does this mean? The Buddha is saying two things:

1. **His teaching leads to not quarreling** — not arguing with anyone
2. **Perceptions don't underlie those who follow the teaching** — meaning, they don't get trapped in mental concepts

But this was too cryptic for Daṇḍapāṇi. He was confused and unimpressed, shaking his head as he left. He didn't understand what the Buddha was talking about.

### Why Was This Answer So Hard to Understand?

The Buddha was describing the end result of practice—a state where you don't quarrel and aren't trapped by perceptions. But he wasn't explaining the practical process. It's like saying "if you follow the path, you'll reach the mountain" without explaining the path itself.

This is why the monks asked for clarification afterward.

---

## Part Two: The Buddha's Short Explanation

### The Monks Ask for Help

After Daṇḍapāṇi left, the monks approached the Buddha and said: "In what way is it that perceptions do not underlie the Tathāgata?" (Tathāgata is a title for the Buddha meaning "one who has thus gone.")

The Buddha gave a brief answer, but again without full explanation:

"A person is beset by judgments born of proliferating perception. If nothing is found worth grasping in what they arise from, the underlying tendencies cease—desire, aversion, views, doubt, conceit, craving for existence, and ignorance. Then quarrels, disputes, and conflict end."

Let's break this down:

**"A person is beset by judgments born of proliferating perception"** — Your mind is overwhelmed by judgments that come from mental proliferation (endless thinking and story-making).

**"If nothing is found worth grasping in what they arise from"** — If you stop grabbing onto and believing these stories and judgments.

**"the underlying tendencies cease"** — Then the deep patterns of desire, aversion, doubt, and ignorance naturally stop.

**"Then quarrels, disputes, and conflict end"** — And fighting with yourself or others stops.

But again, this is abstract. The Buddha explains that the key is something called "papañca"—mental proliferation. But what exactly is that? The monks needed more detail.

## Part Three: Mahākaccāna's Detailed Explanation

### Who Was Mahākaccāna?

At this point, the monks turned to a senior monk named Mahākaccāna Thera (Great Kaccāna). He had a special reputation: whenever the Buddha gave a short teaching that was hard to understand, Mahākaccāna could explain it step by step in detail.

The monks asked him to unpack the Buddha's teaching. Mahākaccāna then gave a systematic explanation that became one of the most important teachings in Buddhism.

### The Five-Step Chain

Mahākaccāna explained that conflict arises through a chain of five steps. Let's examine each one:

**Step 1: Sense Contact (phassa)**

Everything begins with contact between your senses and the world. Your eye sees a form. Your ear hears a sound. Your nose smells an odor. Your tongue tastes something. Your body feels a texture. Your mind has a thought.

The Buddha explained that sense contact depends on three things:
- A sense faculty (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, or mind)
- An object (form, sound, odor, taste, touch, or mental object)
- Consciousness (awareness that receives the contact)

For example: Your eye (sense faculty) contacts a beautiful painting (object), and eye-consciousness (awareness) registers it. Contact happens.

This is neutral. Contact itself doesn't cause suffering. It's just the meeting of sense and object.

**Step 2: Feeling (vedanā)**

Immediately after contact, a feeling arises. This is one of three types:

- **Pleasant feeling** — Your eye sees something beautiful; your ear hears something you like
- **Unpleasant feeling** — You see something ugly; you hear a harsh sound
- **Neutral feeling** — Something that doesn't particularly attract or repel you

Again, this is still quite natural. It's the mind's immediate response to contact.

**Step 3: Perception (saññā)**

Next, perception arises. Perception is the mind's recognition and labeling of what's happening. You don't just feel; you recognize what you're feeling about.

For example: You see a person's face and perceive "this is my friend." You taste something and perceive "this is delicious." You feel a pain and perceive "this is bad."

Perception is the mind naming and categorizing the experience. It's still relatively simple—just recognition and labeling.

**Step 4: Thinking (vitakka)**

Next, thinking begins. This is where inner commentary starts.

Once you've perceived "this is my friend" or "this is delicious," your mind starts creating thoughts about it. "I like my friend. I should spend time with them. What did they think about what I said?" Or with food: "This is delicious. I want more. I wonder if there's more in the kitchen."

Thinking is the mind's running narrative about what's happening.

**Step 5: Proliferation (papañca)**

Finally, proliferation—the mental explosion. This is where the problems begin.

Papañca is when the mind takes thinking and runs wild with it. It creates endless stories, judgments, self-referencing thoughts, and drama. The mind spins narratives like:

- "This is mine"
- "This is me"
- "This is what I am"
- "They don't appreciate me"
- "I deserve better"
- "They're against me"
- "I need to fight back"
- "Nobody understands me"

These stories aren't based on reality. They're the mind's fabrications—stories we add to simple experience.

### Where Conflict Comes From

Here's the crucial insight: **Conflict arises from papañca, not from the original contact or even from the feeling.**

The Buddha said: "From papañca arise conflicts, disputes, and quarrels."

Think about it. A friend doesn't text you back. The contact: your eye sees the empty message screen. The feeling: a slight discomfort. The perception: "no message from my friend." The thinking: "They might be upset with me. Maybe they don't want to talk to me."

But then papañca kicks in: "They're avoiding me because I'm not good enough. Nobody really cares about me. Everyone leaves me eventually. I'm alone in this world."

That's papañca—the mental proliferation that creates a huge story out of a simple event.

### The Buddha's Approval

When the monks reported Mahākaccāna's explanation back to the Buddha, the Buddha praised him highly: "If you had asked me, I would have explained it in exactly this way."

This was significant praise. The Buddha was confirming that Mahākaccāna had understood the teaching perfectly.

### Why It's Called the Honeyball

Then Venerable Ānanda (another senior monk) made a poetic observation. He said the teaching was like a honeyball—a honey-cake that was sweet throughout. He explained: "Wherever you taste it, it is sweet. Likewise, whichever angle you examine this teaching from, it gives wisdom and clarity."

Because of this comparison, the Buddha named it the **Madhupiṇḍika Sutta—The Honeyball Discourse.**

## Part Four: The Core Teaching—Where Suffering Actually Comes From

### A Key Insight

The Honeyball Sutta answers a fundamental question that many people get wrong: **Where does suffering come from?**

Many people think suffering comes from external events. "I'm suffering because my circumstances are bad" or "I'm suffering because bad things happened to me."

But the sutta shows something different. Suffering comes from the chain of contact → feeling → perception → thinking → proliferation.

More specifically: **Suffering comes from papañca—the endless stories we add to simple experience.**

### The Chain Can Be Interrupted

Here's what's important to understand: The chain has weak links.

The Buddha teaches that by cutting the chain at certain points, you can prevent papañca from arising. And when papañca doesn't arise, conflict ceases.

The sutta specifically points to **feeling and perception** as the critical junctures:

"If nothing is found worth grasping in what they arise from, the underlying tendencies cease."

This means: If you observe feeling and perception without grabbing onto them, without turning them into stories, then papañca doesn't develop.

### The Defilements That Follow Papañca

The sutta lists what comes from papañca:

- Desire (wanting what you don't have)
- Aversion (pushing away what you have)
- Views (strong opinions and beliefs)
- Doubt (paralysing uncertainty)
- Conceit (thinking you're better than others)
- Craving for existence (needing to matter, to prove yourself)
- Ignorance (not understanding reality)

All of these defilements arise from papañca—from believing the mental stories.

## Part Five: How TWIM Practice Works With This Teaching

### The 6Rs as Interrupting Papañca

The modern TWIM practice offers the 6Rs method, which directly applies this ancient teaching. Let's see how:

**Recognize** — You notice papañca arising. "I'm spinning stories about what that comment meant." Or "I'm creating a whole narrative about what might happen." Simply noticing that you're in proliferation is the first step to stopping it.

**Release** — You let go of the grip on the story. You're not fighting the story or trying to force it away. You just stop feeding it energy. You stop believing it needs to be resolved right now.

**Relax** — You ease the tension that papañca created in your body and mind. When you were spinning stories, your body probably tensed up. Your mind was racing. Now you relax that contraction.

**Re-smile** — You reconnect with ease and acceptance. The smile represents stepping back from the drama of papañca. It's saying, "Oh, my mind did it again. That's okay. This is just how minds work."

**Return** — You bring your attention back to the present moment. Back to your breath, back to your body, back to what's actually happening right now instead of what your mind is inventing.

**Repeat** — You practice this repeatedly until it becomes natural. Each time you interrupt papañca with the 6Rs, you weaken its power over you.

### The Critical Juncture: Feeling

The sutta points to feeling as especially important. In TWIM practice, this is why **feeling awareness is so central.**

When you notice a feeling arising—pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral—this is your critical moment. If you can observe the feeling without grabbing onto it, without turning it into a story, papañca doesn't develop.

But if you let your mind start creating stories about the feeling—"This feeling means something is wrong" or "This feeling is wonderful; I want more"—then proliferation begins.

This is why TWIM emphasizes: **Notice the feeling tone. That's where the choice point is.**

### Cutting Off Papañca Before It Starts

The genius of this teaching is that you don't have to fight papañca once it's fully developed. Instead, you can interrupt it earlier in the chain.

Here's how it works in practice:

**Scenario:** You're at work and your boss makes a critical comment about your work.

**Step 1: Contact** — Your ear hears the words. Neutral so far.

**Step 2: Feeling** — You feel unpleasant (stung, embarrassed). Still manageable.

**Step 3: Perception** — Your mind recognizes "this is criticism." Still okay.

**Step 4: Thinking** — Your mind starts thinking "My boss doesn't respect me. Maybe I'm not good at my job."

**Step 5: Proliferation — WITHOUT AWARENESS:** Your mind spirals: "I'm terrible at my job. Everyone thinks I'm incompetent. I'll probably get fired. I'll lose my house. My life is falling apart."

**Step 5: Proliferation — WITH AWARENESS:** At some point, you notice "I'm spinning a story about losing my house based on one critical comment. That's papañca." You apply the 6Rs: Recognize the proliferation, Release the grip on the story, Relax your body, Re-smile at how the mind works, Return to what's actually true right now: "I received feedback. That's real. The catastrophe isn't."

In this second scenario, you've cut off papañca and prevented unnecessary suffering.

## Part Six: How the Sutta and TWIM Align

### The Same Teaching, Different Language

What's remarkable is how precisely TWIM practice implements this ancient sutta.

The sutta identifies feeling and perception as the critical points where the chain can be broken. TWIM practice does exactly this—it teaches you to notice feelings and observe them without clinging to them or turning them into stories.

The sutta explains that papañca creates conflict both internally (conflict with yourself through self-judgment) and externally (conflict with others through projecting stories onto them). TWIM practice works on both levels—by interrupting papañca, you reduce both internal conflict and interpersonal conflict.

The sutta teaches that attachment to these stories ("This is mine, this is me, this is what I am") is what perpetuates the problem. TWIM's "release" and "re-smile" steps directly work with this—by not identifying with the stories, by observing them as impersonal mental processes, you naturally release attachment.

### Bhante Vimalaramsi's Key Insight

Bhante Vimalaramsi, who developed TWIM, often said: "You don't have to believe your thoughts."

This is exactly what the sutta teaches. The proliferating thoughts that arise from papañca aren't truth. They're the mind's story-making. You can observe them without believing them.

And when you stop believing the stories—when you recognize them, release your grip on them, relax into ease, and return to what's actually here—then, as the sutta says, "quarrels, disputes, and conflict end."

---

## Part Seven: Practical Applications

### Internal Conflict

Most people experience internal conflict constantly—arguments with themselves about what they should do, who they are, whether they're good enough.

The Honeyball Sutta explains where this comes from: papañca. Your mind creates stories about yourself and you believe them. "I'm not smart enough." "I'm too fat." "Nobody likes me." "I always mess up."

These aren't facts. They're stories created through papañca.

Using the 6Rs:

1. **Recognize** the story. "My mind is telling me I'm not smart enough."
2. **Release** the belief in it. "This is just a thought my mind produced."
3. **Relax** the tension around the story.
4. **Re-smile** at how the mind creates these narratives.
5. **Return** to what's true right now—you're sitting here, breathing, alive.
6. **Repeat** this whenever the story arises again.

Over time, you stop believing the papañca, and the internal conflict softens.

### Interpersonal Conflict

Much interpersonal conflict comes from projecting stories onto others. "They don't like me." "They're trying to hurt me." "They think I'm stupid."

But these are often papañca—stories your mind created, not what the other person actually thinks or intends.

The sutta shows how this works. When someone does something—even something neutral—your mind might spin a story: "They meant that as a criticism. They're against me. I need to defend myself."

Then conflict arises, often based on a misunderstanding.

By applying the 6Rs before you react, you can interrupt papañca and respond more wisely:

1. Someone does something.
2. You notice a feeling (perhaps hurt or anger).
3. You recognize that your mind is starting to create a story about what they meant.
4. You apply the 6Rs to interrupt the papañca.
5. You respond to what actually happened, not to the story your mind created.

### Worry and Anxiety

Much worry and anxiety is pure papañca. Something small happens, and your mind creates an elaborate story about terrible future consequences.

"I felt a weird pain. That means I have a serious disease. I'll have to undergo surgery. I'll lose my job. My life is ruined."

All of that is proliferation based on a single, probably insignificant sensation.

The sutta shows the solution: at the point where you notice the feeling and perception, before the proliferation really takes off, you can apply the 6Rs and interrupt it.

This doesn't mean denying real problems. It means distinguishing between what's actually happening and what your mind is inventing.

## Part Eight: The Deep Psychology of the Teaching

### Why We Create Papañca

The question naturally arises: Why does the mind create all these stories? Why doesn't it just observe experience simply?

The sutta hints at the answer through the defilements that follow papañca: desire, aversion, conceit, craving for becoming.

In essence, we create stories because we want to matter. We want to be right. We want to be safe. We want to prove ourselves.

When something happens, the raw contact doesn't tell us any of these things. So the mind creates stories that do: "This shows I'm competent" or "This proves I'm being treated unfairly" or "This shows I'm lovable."

These stories feel necessary because they're tied to our sense of self and security. Without understanding this, we believe them automatically.

### The Freedom That Comes From Understanding

The sutta's teaching leads to a profound freedom. Once you understand that papañca is just the mind's story-making habit, you can:

1. Notice when it's happening
2. Not take it personally
3. Not believe it automatically
4. Observe it with a kind of gentle humor
5. Let it pass without acting on it

This is what the sutta means by "one does not quarrel with anyone." When you understand papañca, you don't react to the stories—yours or others'. You don't fight based on fabrications. You respond to what's actually there.

---

## Part Nine: Making This Practical in Your Life

### A Daily Practice

You can apply this teaching throughout your day:

**Morning:** Set an intention to notice papañca. "Today, I'll try to catch when my mind is spinning stories instead of seeing what's actually happening."

**During the day:** Multiple times, pause and check: "Is my mind creating stories right now? Am I believing thoughts as if they're facts?"

**When conflict arises:** Use the 6Rs specifically at that moment. Interrupt the papañca before it escalates.

**Evening:** Reflect. When did you notice papañca? When did you get caught in it? What happened in each case?

### Working With Feelings

Since the sutta emphasizes feeling as the critical juncture, develop your feeling awareness:

1. **Throughout the day, notice feelings.** Don't just think about your experience; notice the feeling tone of each moment.
2. **Get curious about feelings.** Pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral? Where in your body do you feel it?
3. **Practice not immediately acting on feelings.** When something feels unpleasant, pause before reacting. Notice the feeling. Apply the 6Rs.
4. **Watch how feelings change.** That unpleasant feeling you had five minutes ago—where is it now?

This simple practice of feeling awareness interrupts papañca before it fully develops.

### Key Questions to Ask Yourself

When you're caught in a conflict or difficulty:

- "What am I actually experiencing right now?" (Contact and feeling)
- "What story is my mind telling about this?" (Papañca)
- "Is that story definitely true, or is it one possible interpretation?" (Questioning papañca)
- "What would change if I didn't believe that story?" (Freedom from papañca)

## Part Ten: Conclusion—Simple but Profound

### The Elegance of the Teaching

The Honeyball Sutta is elegant because it's simple but describes something profound. In just five steps, it explains:

1. Where suffering comes from
2. Why we create conflict
3. What perpetuates our problems
4. Where we can interrupt the process
5. What happens when we do

The teaching doesn't require belief. You can test it. You can watch your own mind doing exactly what the sutta describes: contact, feeling, perception, thinking, proliferation.

### Integration With Modern Life

What's remarkable is how this 2,500-year-old teaching applies perfectly to modern life with all its technology, complexity, and speed.

The underlying pattern remains the same: Contact (you see a social media post, an email, a text). Feeling (pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral). Perception (recognition of what it means). Thinking (inner commentary). Proliferation (the mind spinning an elaborate story).

The TWIM practice gives you tools to interrupt this pattern right now, today, with situations you actually face.

### The Promise of the Teaching

The sutta promises: "Then quarrels, disputes, and conflict end."

This doesn't mean you'll never have disagreements or challenges. It means you'll stop fighting based on stories and fabrications. You'll respond to what's actually here.

This brings a profound peace—not the absence of challenge, but the absence of the unnecessary suffering that comes from believing the mind's proliferations.

### Your Practice Matters

Each time you notice papañca and apply the 6Rs, you're not just solving one small problem. You're training your mind to see through the fundamental pattern that creates suffering.

Over time, this changes your life. Your internal conflicts soften. Your relationships improve. Your anxiety decreases. Your clarity increases.

This is what the Buddha meant by the non-quarreling teaching and what Mahākaccāna revealed step by step.

This is the sweet wisdom of the Honeyball—wherever you taste it, it teaches you about freedom from the stories that imprison you.
