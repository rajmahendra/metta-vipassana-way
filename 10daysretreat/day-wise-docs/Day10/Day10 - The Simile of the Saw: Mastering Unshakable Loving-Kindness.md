# The Simile of the Saw: Mastering Unshakable Loving-Kindness

The **Simile of the Saw** (from the Kakacūpama Sutta) is a monumental teaching that illustrates the highest possible standard of mind training. It is not just a moral instruction; it describes the ultimate state of freedom where the mind cannot be provoked into anger, no matter the provocation. This is the core of the **Metta Vipassana Way (TWIM)** practice: training the mind to respond with wisdom instead of reaction.

## 1. The Heart of the Simile: Ultimate Training in Non-Identification

The Buddha uses the most extreme example imaginable to set the bar for the spiritual aspirant:

> “Even if low-down bandits were to sever you limb from limb with a two-handled saw, anyone who had a malevolent thought on that account would not be following my instructions.”

### The Importance and the TWIM Connection

**Importance:** This instruction is not suggesting passive submission to harm. Rather, it describes the **ultimate training in non-anger and non-identification**. It points to a stage where one's mind **cannot be provoked** into aversion because **craving and clinging have been abandoned**. If there is no sense of "I, me, mine" being harmed, there is no one left to get angry.

**TWIM Practice:** In TWIM, this corresponds to the stage where **loving-kindness becomes fully developed** and unconditional. It is a state of **deep equanimity and wisdom** where the mind naturally radiates goodwill without condition, no matter how difficult the situation. This freedom is the **freedom of non-clinging**.

## 2. The Practical Training Formula: The 6Rs

The profound goal of unshakable loving-kindness is achieved through a simple, repeatable instruction. Throughout the Sutta, the Buddha repeats this essential mind-training refrain:

> “My mind will not degenerate. I will utter no bad words. I will remain full of sympathy, with a heart of love and no secret hate.”

### How TWIM Cultivates This Attitude

This attitude is precisely what TWIM cultivates moment-to-moment through **the 6Rs**:

1.  **Recognize** when aversion (anger, irritation, judgment) arises.
2.  **Release** the unwholesome feeling or thought immediately.
3.  **Relax** the bodily tension that craving has caused.
4.  **Re-Smile** (soften the mind and bring up a wholesome uplift).
5.  **Return** to the object of meditation (e.g., loving-kindness or compassion).
6.  **Repeat** as necessary.

Each time anger or irritation arises—even at something minor in daily life—this is where the “Simile of the Saw” becomes real practice. You train yourself to respond with loving-kindness and release, rather than reactivity. Your job is to let go of the tension and the craving that wants the situation to be different.

## 3. Layers of Meaning in the Sutta

The Simile is supported by preparatory stories and teachings that address common pitfalls in practice.

### A. Phagguna and the Trap of Attachment

The story of the monk Phagguna illustrates **worldly attachment disguised as compassion**. Phagguna's close ties to a group of nuns led to **partiality** and a need to defend "mine" and "theirs."

**Importance and TWIM Connection:** The Buddha points out that this partiality arises from **craving (*taṇhā*)**—the root of suffering. In TWIM, this is exactly what the meditator sees through the steps of Dependent Origination: **Contact → Feeling → Craving → Clinging → Becoming**. Whenever we identify with "my" side or "my" group, we start that chain. The practice is to **see the craving, relax it, and radiate loving-kindness** to all, without conditions.

### B. Vedehikā and the Illusion of Calm

The story of the laywoman Vedehikā and her maid Kāḷī distinguishes between **superficial calm** and **true serenity**. Vedehikā *appeared* peaceful only because she was unprovoked; when her maid challenged her three times, her deep-seated anger erupted.

**Importance and TWIM Connection:** Real peace doesn’t mean avoiding triggers; **it means maintaining an unshakable, relaxed awareness when triggers appear**. The practice of **Relax–Smile–Radiate** during daily life is how the TWIM meditator ensures that their "outer calm" is genuinely matched by "inner calm."

### C. The Five Kinds of Speech and Non-Reaction

The Buddha enumerates five types of criticism—from beneficial and timely to harsh and hateful—and shows how the wise practitioner should respond with a heart **“like the earth, like space, like the Ganges, like a soft catskin bag.”**

These similes represent a deepening **quality of equanimity**:
* **Earth:** steady and patient, unable to be shaken.
* **Space:** open and non-grasping, offering no place for the words to land.
* **Water (Ganges):** cooling and flowing, washing away the heat of anger.
* **Soft leather:** refined, responsive, but entirely **not reactive**.

**TWIM Connection:** These qualities mirror the **Brahmavihāras** (loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity) as progressively refined forms of the **mettā practice** in TWIM. Each time we successfully use the 6Rs, we embody these similes by not letting the outer words or actions disturb the inner peace.

## 4. The Saw and the End of Hatred

When the Buddha finally reveals the Simile of the Saw, he is pointing to the **complete transcendence of anger and ill-will**—the hallmark of a fully awakened mind.

**Importance and TWIM Application:** The natural outcome of correct meditation, as emphasized in TWIM, is that when you see and relax craving at every arising, **the mind stops taking things personally**. Without the strong illusion of **“I, me, mine,”** there is nothing for anger to land on. The mind remains like **space** or **the Ganges**, unburned and unshaken by the flames of ill-will.

The key insight that underpins the entire Sutta is: **“You cannot stop others from acting unskillfully, but you can train your own mind not to join them.”** This is the ultimate practical meaning of compassion: not reacting out of ego or self-interest, but responding out of wisdom and kindness, thereby ensuring your own freedom.
