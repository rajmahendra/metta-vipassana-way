# Jhāna and Mindfulness: Understanding Deep Meditation and Continuous Awareness

## Introduction: The Difference Between Absorption and Insight

Most people think of meditation as entering a special trance-like state where your mind goes blank and you experience something extraordinary. But the Buddha taught something quite different. In two important suttas—**MN 111** (The Discourse on Sāriputta) and **MN 10** (The Foundations of Mindfulness)—the Buddha describes meditation not as a state you escape into, but as a progressive deepening of awareness where you see reality more and more clearly.

This article explores these two suttas and shows how they reveal the true nature of deep meditation. We'll examine what jhāna really is, why it matters, how modern TWIM (Teaching With Insight Meditation) practice aligns with these ancient teachings, and most importantly, how anyone can develop these states through consistent, relaxed practice.

## Part One: Understanding Jhāna—What It Actually Is

### The Common Misunderstanding

Many meditators think jhāna is a state where you become absorbed and lose awareness. You enter a trance, lose contact with the external world, and experience something exotic. This is a misunderstanding that has caused confusion for centuries.

The **MN 111** sutta, recorded by the Buddha's conversation with Sāriputta, corrects this misunderstanding. It shows that jhāna is not absorption into blankness. Instead, it's a state of deep, sustained focus where your awareness actually becomes clearer and sharper, not dimmer.

### What the Sutta Shows

In MN 111, the Buddha describes Sāriputta entering different levels of jhāna. But here's the crucial part: **at each stage, Sāriputta is fully aware of what's happening.** He can observe the mental factors present, see how they arise, watch them persist, and notice when they cease.

This means jhāna is not unconsciousness or trance. It's the opposite—it's super-consciousness, a state where awareness is so refined and focused that you can observe subtle mental processes that normally escape your notice.

### The Five Factors of First Jhāna

When you enter the first jhāna (according to the sutta), five specific factors come together:

**1. Applied Attention (vitakka)** — Your mind is placed on an object. You're thinking about something, but in a gentle way—not analytical thinking, but directional thinking that says "this is what I'm focusing on."

**2. Sustained Attention (vicāra)** — Once you've placed your attention, you keep it there. It's not effortful gripping; it's more like your mind staying with the object naturally.

**3. Joy (pīti)** — A natural uplift comes as your mind settles. It's not forced happiness; it's the mind's natural state when not caught in craving or aversion. Often described as effervescent or bubbly.

**4. Happiness (sukha)** — Different from joy, happiness is the deep ease and contentment that comes with stability. It's the peace of mind that arises when restlessness quiets.

**5. One-Pointedness (ekaggatā)** — Your attention becomes unified. Your mind moves as one coherent whole rather than being scattered across multiple concerns. This is collected awareness.

### How Sāriputta Used His Awareness

Here's what makes MN 111 so remarkable: while in jhāna, Sāriputta didn't just experience these factors. He **observed** them. He could watch:

- How each factor arose
- How it stayed present
- How it eventually ceased

This observation is crucial. It shows that jhāna is not a blank state but a **state of heightened observation**. Your mind is so settled and clear that you can see subtle processes operating moment to moment.

## Part Two: The Key Insight—Impermanence Within Jhāna

### Understanding Arising and Passing

One of the most important teachings in the sutta is what Sāriputta understood while in jhāna: **"Not having been, they come to be; having come to be, they vanish."**

This is a direct observation of impermanence. While in a deep, peaceful state, Sāriputta could see that even the pleasant factors of jhāna weren't permanent. They arose, were present for a time, and then ceased.

This is revolutionary because it shows that **insight can happen within deep peace.** You don't have to be agitated or analytical to see reality clearly. In fact, the deeper your peace, the clearer you can see impermanence operating.

### Why This Matters for Modern Practice

This insight directly contradicts the idea that jhāna is an escape from reality. Instead, it's a **clearer way of seeing reality**. The deeper your meditation, the more clearly you see how everything is constantly changing.

In practical terms, this means that when you're in a deep, peaceful state during meditation, you're not supposed to zone out or become unconscious. You're supposed to maintain a witnessing awareness that observes what's happening.

## Part Three: The Pattern Across All Jhānas

### How the Progression Works

According to MN 111, as Sāriputta progresses through the different jhānas, a consistent pattern emerges:

**1. He enters a jhāna.**

**2. He discerns what factors are present** in that particular jhāna.

**3. He sees them arise, persist, and cease.**

**4. He understands their impermanence and non-self nature** (that these are impersonal processes, not belonging to "me").

**5. He keeps his mind balanced:** "not getting involved, not shying away, independent, liberated."

**6. He realizes:** "There is an escape beyond."

This last point is particularly important. After each jhāna, Sāriputta sees that there's something beyond it. This drives him deeper, toward higher states. Eventually, through this progression, he reaches **cessation of perception and feeling**—where even the subtle factors of the highest jhānas stop—and at that point, he realizes "there is no escape beyond." He has reached the ultimate goal.

### The Progression of Jhānas

**First Jhāna:** Joy and happiness are strong; thinking is still present but settled.

**Second Jhāna:** Thinking drops away; joy and happiness deepen; one-pointedness becomes more unified.

**Third Jhāna:** Even joy fades; happiness becomes more subtle and profound; equanimity grows.

**Fourth Jhāna:** All positive and negative feelings subside, leaving perfect equanimity and clarity.

**Beyond the Fourth Jhāna:** There are four more subtle states related to infinite space, infinite consciousness, nothingness, and "neither-perception-nor-non-perception." Finally, there's cessation of perception and feeling, where all mental activity stops.

### What Happens at Cessation

This is where the sutta becomes truly remarkable. In the deepest states, particularly **cessation of perception and feeling**, there is literally no mental activity. Sāriputta cannot observe the factors during cessation because there's nothing to observe—consciousness itself has stopped.

But here's the crucial part: **when he emerges from cessation, he reviews what happened and realizes that all perception and feeling had stopped.**

This recognition is transformative. It shows the ultimate nature of dependent origination—the Buddha's core teaching that everything arises in dependence on conditions. By seeing the complete stopping of mental activity, Sāriputta directly understands how dependent origination can be cut off at the level of craving, leading to the unconditioned reality called Nirvana.

## Part Four: How TWIM Practice Aligns With These Suttas

### The 6Rs as Applied Mindfulness

The TWIM approach offers a practical method—the 6Rs—that operationalizes exactly what the suttas describe. Let's examine how each step corresponds to the sutta's teachings:

**Recognize** — This is direct observation, just like Sāriputta observing the jhāna factors. You notice what's present without judgment.

**Release** — You let go of your grip on the experience. This corresponds to Sāriputta's ability to remain "independent, not getting involved." You're not clinging to pleasant experiences or pushing away unpleasant ones.

**Relax** — You ease the tension around the experience. This allows the natural settling that the sutta describes, where hindrances fade naturally rather than being suppressed.

**Re-smile** — You reconnect with gentle ease and acceptance. This maintains the joy and happiness that naturally arise in settled meditation.

**Return** — You bring attention back to your object of meditation. This maintains the applied and sustained attention (vitakka and vicāra) that characterize jhāna.

**Repeat** — Through repeated practice, you deepen the patterns of settling and observing that naturally develop into jhāna-like states.

### Direct Connection to MN 111

The brilliance of the 6Rs is that they train exactly what Sāriputta demonstrated: **relaxed observation without clinging.** Each time you apply the 6Rs, you're practicing Sāriputta's skill of noticing what's happening while remaining independent and unattached.

In TWIM terms, you're not trying to force yourself into jhāna. Instead, you're creating the conditions where jhāna naturally arises—by letting go of hindrances, relaxing tension, and maintaining gentle attention.

### Why TWIM Emphasizes Loving-Kindness

TWIM often uses loving-kindness meditation as the primary practice. This is particularly relevant to the sutta's emphasis on antidotes to hindrances.

The sutta describes how each hindrance has a natural antidote:

- **Sensual Desire** is antidoted by **Contentment and Joy**
- **Ill Will** is antidoted by **Loving-Kindness**
- **Sloth and Torpor** are antidoted by **Energy and Applied Attention**
- **Restlessness and Remorse** are antidoted by **Tranquility and Happiness**
- **Doubt** is antidoted by **Confidence and Wisdom**

By meditating on loving-kindness, you naturally access the antidotes that allow hindrances to fade. The mind naturally settles when you're cultivating genuine well-wishing toward yourself and others.

## Part Five: The Four Foundations of Mindfulness (MN 10)

### The Direct Path to Awakening

The **Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (MN 10)** is considered one of the most important Buddhist discourses. It describes what the Buddha called "the direct path" for purification, overcoming sorrow, ending pain, realizing the path, and attaining Nirvana.

This sutta teaches four specific areas where you direct your mindfulness:

**1. Body (kāya)**

This includes:
- Mindfulness of breathing—observing the in-breath and out-breath, noting how breathing affects the whole body, allowing the breath to naturally calm as you observe it
- Awareness of postures—noticing when you're walking, standing, sitting, or lying down
- Clear comprehension of daily activities—being aware during eating, moving, looking, speaking
- Contemplations—reflecting on the nature of the body (though TWIM emphasizes modern relevance over traditional corpse contemplations)

**In TWIM practice:** Rather than analyzing body parts or dwelling on decay, you simply notice bodily sensations as they arise. When tension or pain appears, you apply the 6Rs to release craving around it and relax.

**2. Feelings (vedanā)**

This is the core entry point for TWIM practice. The sutta describes three types of feeling:

- **Pleasant feelings**—sensory pleasures (nice sights, sounds, tastes, smells, touches, thoughts) and spiritual pleasures (joy from jhāna, happiness from loving-kindness)
- **Unpleasant feelings**—sensory pain (foul smells, unpleasant sights, irritating sounds, bitter tastes, uncomfortable touch, negative thoughts) and meditation difficulties
- **Neutral feelings**—neither pleasant nor unpleasant; indifferent sensations

**In TWIM practice:** This is the crucial entry point. Every mental distraction manifests as a feeling tone. When desire arises, it has a particular feeling quality. When aversion arises, it has a different quality. When doubt arises, it has yet another quality.

By noticing the feeling tone, you can apply the 6Rs precisely. This directly weakens craving (the root of all suffering according to the Buddha) and builds insight into impermanence.

**3. Mind (citta)**

The sutta teaches observing different states of mind:

- Greedy mind vs. non-greedy mind
- Hateful mind vs. non-hateful mind
- Deluded mind vs. non-deluded mind
- Contracted mind vs. expanded mind
- Scattered mind vs. concentrated mind
- Liberated mind vs. unliberated mind

**In TWIM practice:** During meditation, you notice when your mind is restless, dull, or uplifted. Instead of pushing away hindrances or clinging to positive states, you see them as impersonal processes. The 6Rs help maintain balance, naturally cultivating equanimity.

**4. Dhammas (Principles/Natural Laws)**

This is the insight dimension, where you observe the principles underlying all phenomena:

**Five Hindrances** — You see how desire, aversion, sloth, restlessness, and doubt arise and how they cease when conditions change.

**Five Aggregates** — Form, feeling, perception, mental formations, consciousness. You notice these as impersonal processes, not as "mine."

**Six Sense Bases** — Eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, and how these bases naturally produce sensations that can trap you in craving and clinging if you're not aware.

**Seven Awakening Factors** — Mindfulness, investigation, energy, joy, tranquility, concentration, equanimity. You notice these naturally unfold in your practice.

**Four Noble Truths** — Suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path to cessation. You directly experience these through practice.

**In TWIM practice:** This is where dependent origination is directly experienced. When you apply the 6Rs consistently, you see how craving arises, how it conditions clinging, and how releasing the craving leads to ease. You're witnessing the Buddha's fundamental teaching operating in real time.

### The Revolutionary Promise

The sutta makes a remarkable claim: if you practice these four foundations fully for just seven years, seven months, and seven days, one of two things will happen:

1. You'll attain arahantship (full enlightenment) in this lifetime
2. If there's some small remaining attachment, you'll at least become a non-returner (someone who won't be reborn in the sensual realm and will attain enlightenment in a heavenly realm)

This isn't spiritual mythology. This is the Buddha saying that this practice method works reliably.

## Part Six: How the Suttas and TWIM Work Together

### The Same Process, Different Framework

What's remarkable is that MN 111 and MN 10 describe the same process from different angles:

**MN 111** focuses on the vertical progression—how Sāriputta moves through increasingly subtle states of meditation, ultimately reaching cessation and full liberation.

**MN 10** focuses on the horizontal expansion—how you observe all phenomena across four domains (body, feeling, mind, principles) from the perspective of non-clinging.

Both are describing the same awakening process: observing reality with increasing clarity, seeing impermanence and non-self, releasing clinging, and ultimately understanding dependent origination so completely that it's cut off, leading to Nirvana.

### How TWIM Operationalizes Both Suttas

**For MN 111:** The 6Rs teach you how to be like Sāriputta—observing the processes of your mind without clinging, recognizing when factors arise, and allowing them to naturally settle. By doing this consistently, you naturally develop into deeper states of meditation, where your awareness becomes even more refined.

**For MN 10:** The 6Rs give you a practical way to observe all four foundations. You notice bodily sensations, you track the feeling tones that accompany all experiences, you observe mental states, and you see the principles of dependent origination operating. All of this happens naturally through the simple practice of noticing and releasing.

### Bhante Vimalaramsi's Key Insight

Bhante Vimalaramsi, the modern teacher who developed TWIM, clarified an important misunderstanding: **the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta is not about dry, mechanical noting of experience.** It's about relaxed, clear mindfulness that sees how phenomena arise and pass.

This is a crucial clarification because some meditation traditions have interpreted the sutta as requiring constant labeling and noting—creating a kind of clinical detachment. But the sutta itself and the TWIM interpretation emphasize something warmer: **a mindfulness that's connected, present, and aware, while remaining unattached.**

The smile in "Re-smile" is actually the key. It's not a forced smile but an expression of the mind's natural ease and friendliness. By maintaining this quality, you practice the sutta's teachings in a living, embodied way rather than as dry technique.

## Part Seven: Practical Integration

### A Complete Practice Session

Here's how both suttas come together in a practical TWIM meditation session:

**Setup (5 minutes):**
- Sit comfortably, establish good posture
- Set an intention: "I'll practice with relaxed attention, observing without clinging"
- Recall the five precepts, establishing ethical foundation
- Begin with loving-kindness toward yourself: "May I be safe, peaceful, and free from suffering"

**Main Practice (20-30 minutes):**

**Body awareness:** Feel your body sitting. Notice the contact points. Feel the breath moving through your body. When tension arises, apply the 6Rs: Recognize it, Release the tension, Relax deeply, Re-smile, Return to loving-kindness.

**Feeling awareness:** Notice the feeling tone of each experience. Is it pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral? When you notice craving (wanting pleasant feelings) or aversion (pushing away unpleasant feelings), apply the 6Rs.

**Mind awareness:** Notice the quality of your mind. Is it clear or cloudy? Settled or restless? When hindrances appear, you know what they are and can work with them skillfully.

**Principles awareness:** As you sit, you directly experience the Buddha's teachings. You see how craving produces tension, how releasing craving produces ease. You observe how attention shapes experience. You witness dependent origination in action.

**Closing (5 minutes):**
- Let go of effort and simply rest
- Notice the quality of mind that's present
- Mentally direct the benefit toward all beings

### What to Expect

**Early practice (weeks 1-4):** You'll notice more distractions and disturbances. This isn't because your practice is worse—it's because you're noticing what was always there. This increased awareness is actually progress.

**Developing practice (months 2-3):** Your mind begins to settle naturally. You notice periods of relative peace. The 6Rs becomes more spontaneous. You're touching states similar to what the suttas describe.

**Deepening practice (months 4-6):** Longer periods of ease and clarity. Your mind becomes naturally collected. You experience gentle joy and happiness. You're accessing jhāna-like states without forcing.

**Established practice (6+ months):** Your meditation stabilizes. You experience refined states regularly. Insight begins to deepen—you directly see impermanence, non-self, and the conditioned nature of all phenomena. The practice becomes self-sustaining.

### Key Points to Remember

1. **You don't force jhāna.** Like Sāriputta, you create conditions (precepts, letting go of hindrances, relaxation) and allow jhāna to arise naturally.

2. **Jhāna is not unconsciousness.** It's refined awareness where you observe subtle processes. You're not spacing out; you're waking up.

3. **Observation without clinging is the key.** This is what the suttas emphasize and what the 6Rs train. You watch your experience, but you don't grab onto the pleasant or push away the unpleasant.

4. **Feeling awareness is the entry point.** By noticing how every experience has a feeling tone, and by releasing craving around that feeling tone, you directly practice both suttas' teachings.

5. **The practice leads somewhere.** According to MN 10, consistent practice leads to Nirvana. This isn't a vague spiritual promise; it's describing a direct path that anyone can follow.

## Part Eight: Conclusion—Ancient Wisdom, Modern Practice

### The Bridge Between Old and New

The remarkable thing about TWIM is that it doesn't reject the ancient suttas or create something new. Instead, it shows how the Buddha's teachings can be expressed in contemporary language and made accessible to modern practitioners.

MN 111 describes the ultimate possibilities—how systematic observation of increasingly subtle states leads to enlightenment. MN 10 describes the practical framework—what to observe and how to observe it. TWIM provides the method—the 6Rs—that operationalizes both suttas in a simple, memorable process.

### The Unity of the Path

What emerges from studying these suttas and practicing TWIM is a unified vision of the spiritual path:

- **Precepts** provide the foundation—ethical living creates a mind that can settle
- **Letting go** removes the major obstacles—by releasing hindrances through the 6Rs, the mind naturally settles
- **Relaxation** allows natural unfolding—as you relax, deeper states emerge without forcing
- **Observation** reveals reality—as you observe without clinging, you see impermanence and non-self directly
- **Progression** leads onward—each stage points beyond itself until you reach cessation and ultimate liberation

This isn't a path you climb through willpower or intellectual effort. It's a path of progressive releasing, where each layer of tension and clinging is dissolved, revealing a mind that's naturally clear, peaceful, and wise.

### Your Practice Matters

Whether you practice for ten minutes daily or an hour, whether you meditate once a week or multiple times daily, your practice matters. Each time you sit and practice the 6Rs, you're training your mind in exactly what the Buddha taught:

- Observing without clinging
- Seeing impermanence
- Understanding non-self
- Releasing craving
- Moving toward liberation

You don't need to believe anything. You don't need to adopt a Buddhist worldview. You simply need to sit, observe your experience through the lens of the 6Rs, and notice what happens.

Over time—whether it takes weeks, months, or years—your practice will bear fruit. Your mind will become clearer. Your peace will deepen. Your wisdom will grow. And gradually, the Buddha's teachings will transform from intellectual ideas into direct lived experience.

This is what MN 111 and MN 10 point toward. This is what TWIM practice actualizes. And this is available to you, right now, through the simple act of sitting down and practicing with relaxed, aware attention.

The path is clear. The teachings are simple. The method works. Begin wherever you are, and trust the process.
