### 🌟 What Are the Brahmaviharas?

The Brahmaviharas are four beautiful qualities we all have inside us. When we practice them, our mind becomes lighter, happier, and more peaceful. They are:

1. *Loving-Kindness (Metta)* – Wishing happiness for yourself and others
2. *Compassion (Karuna)* – Caring when others are suffering
3. *Empathetic Joy (Mudita)* – Feeling joy when others succeed
4. *Equanimity (Upekkha)* – Staying calm and balanced in all situations
