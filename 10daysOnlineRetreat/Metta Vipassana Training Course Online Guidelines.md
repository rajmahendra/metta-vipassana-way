**Metta Vipassana Training Course Online Guidelines**

---

### Your Responsibilities for this Course

* You agree to take the **Six Precepts** in the morning and to read some supportive verses to help you set the correct moral and ethical mental environment to sustain your practice. This is very important.

* You agree to sit in meditation at least **twice daily** (morning and evening) for a minimum of **30 minutes**, and to perform a short walking meditation for at least **15 to 20 minutes daily**. Many people walk during their lunch break or after their evening meal; whatever is possible for you is fine.

### Recommended Sitting and Walking Meditation Targets

* **Days 1-2:** Sitting Meditation: Twice for 30 minutes | Walking Meditation: Twice for 15 minutes

* **Days 3-4:** Sitting Meditation: Twice for 45 minutes | Walking Meditation: Twice for 15-20 minutes

* **Days 5-9:** Sitting Meditation: Twice for 1 hour | Walking Meditation: Twice for 15-20 minutes

(This is only for your reference. You can go slower if you need to, but ensure you are continually making progress.)

As your meditation progresses, you may sit for up to 2-3 hours, but this will come naturally.

* You agree to listen to a **Dhamma Talk** provided online in audio or video format (your preference) each evening. These talks are taken from the meditation compilation of our abbot, Venerable "**Bandhe**" Vimalaramsi. These talks are given in clear and simple English.

* You agree that each day you will answer a few small questions in a **Daily Interview Report** and send this report to your guiding teacher.

* Finally, to make maximum progress in your meditation, you agree to cease watching TV, reading newspapers, books, magazines, or spending time on the internet with movies or other types of entertainment during your meditation practice. Only use information when required for your profession; otherwise, avoid it. This helps stop your mind from excessive thinking.

### General Guidelines

* You are asked to agree to observe the **basic rules** during the online meditation course and to continue them as closely as possible in life if they are beneficial to you.

* Do not listen to music during these meditation practices, and stay away from other forms of entertainment such as TV, radio, books, magazines, and newspapers during the meditation course. Please keep your attention focused on your meditation and carefully follow the Guide's instructions; otherwise, it will not grow correctly.

* In this meditation course, you will learn a good form of engaged Buddhism. Meditation, when done correctly, will be interwoven with life.

* We encourage you to continue working, going to school, doing household work, or whatever you usually do each day for work. That is fine. This will prove to you how meditation can be applied in daily life. As we continue, we will discuss how to continue your meditation after the course ends.

### How Should I Sit?

* Sit in a way that your body does not suffer physical pain due to your sitting position. If you are accustomed to the floor, sit on the floor. But if you are not accustomed to that, please sit in a chair.

* It is best to sit in a chair without arms so you do not lean on them or lean on the back of the chair! It is essential not to cut off the natural energy flow of the spine.

* You can put a rolled-up towel at the base of your back to help keep you towards the front of the chair.

* The most important thing about sitting is to **remain motionless** when you are seated—whether on the floor, a chair, a bench, or a rock. Do not move. You want to be comfortable so you can sit for long periods to notice more about how the mind's attention moves.

### Sitting Meditation

* You must agree to sit in meditation for a minimum of 30 minutes in the morning and another 30 minutes at another time during the day. (This is the minimum performance for progress. Sit longer if it goes well and you have the time to do so.)

* Plan to sit for at least **45 minutes on the 3rd day**, **1 hour on the 4th day** and beyond, up to 2 hours if you become comfortable with it later.

* Sit at least twice a day—some people sit up to 5 times and walk 5 times!

### Walking Meditation

* Do not walk slowly during this practice. Take a natural walking pace to increase your energy.

* We recommend that you take a short walk for 15-20 minutes during the middle of your day, perhaps during your lunch hour or break time, and keep smiling.

* This will give you three short sessions a day. Try to make one session 1 hour or a little longer on the weekends as you progress.

### Dhamma Talks

* You will be asked to listen to Bandhe's Dhamma Talk online every night. This is essential for our meditation practices. The talk you should listen to is on the schedule.

* Take notes to help you during the Dhamma Talks. They are **filled with good information**.

* The transcripts for the audio talks are listed below the audio link.

### Submitting the Interview Form

* You will answer a few questions on an Interview Form and then submit it to your teacher each day within that 24-hour period.

* The Guide must hear clearly from you once a day to track your progress. This helps the Guide know how best to help you.

* Daily reports must be filled out to review your progress and provide feedback. Please see your plan.

* Ask your online program guide for the schedule for the **Sutta Talks**. They are all available.

### For Reading

* Read "**Brahmaviharas for Everyone**." Have the book read by your 2nd day of meditation. This short PDF will give you everything you need to know to get started and make quick progress.

### Donations (Dāna)

* Finally: This meditation is brought to you by the **Samatha-Vipassana Trust (SVT)**. SVT support comes from donations for the work we do in these meditations, from individual retreats, and from group retreats. (All funds are used for running the retreats, supporting the monks, and running the Trust.)

* The only purpose of the project is to support the Dhamma.

* You can use **Indian Local Bank**, PayPal, or a Credit Card through the donation page.
